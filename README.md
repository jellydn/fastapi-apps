<h1 align="center">Welcome to fastapi-apps üëã</h1>

> This repository contains two demo applications built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com), managed as a monorepo using [Moon](https://moonrepo.dev).

## Applications

1. **[App 1](./apps/app1/README.md)**: This application is set up using the `poetry` approach for dependency management.
2. **[App 2](./apps/app2/README.md)**: This application is set up using the traditional `requirements.txt` approach for dependency management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: You have installed Python 3.8 or higher. If you need to install a specific version of Python, we recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
- **Moon**: You have installed [Moon](https://moonrepo.dev/), which is used to manage this monorepo.
- **Dependency Management Tools**: Depending on the application, you will need different tools:
  - For App 1, you need pip, which is typically installed with Python.
  - For App 2, you need [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `moon run :install` to install dependencies for both apps

### Running the Apps

Use Moon to run the apps:

#### Run Server
